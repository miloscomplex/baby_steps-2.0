# baby_steps

Baby and toddlers, while being looked after they have diaper changes, feedings, naps & activities throughout the day. Care-Givers need a way to track the information for the children they are looking after.

A User can create an account, log in, denote numerous items individually for each child, add additional children, and delete an individual child's record.

A quick rundown of all the items captured are
- A child's name
- A child's birthdate
- A child's gender
- First nap and duration
- Second nap and duration
- Number of wet diapers
- Number of soiled diapers
- First feeding time
- Second feeding time
- Third feeding time
- A checklist of activities, such as Gym Time and Story Time
- An area to enter additional notes
